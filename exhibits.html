          <h2>COSMOLOGY</h2>
          <p>
            Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
            Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
            about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
            constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
            the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
            journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
            Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our
            solar system.

          <h2>BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE</h2>
          <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
            biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
            the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer
            and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
            understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
            history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant. Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild.
            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

          <h2>ROBOTICS AND AI</h2>
          <p>
            The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
            intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
            applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
            here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

          <h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
          <p>
            As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
            planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
            create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
            planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers
            we currently face including global warming, extinction of species,
            and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
            contribute to a brighter future.
